The d\-Prot protocol was written to meet the demands of very small micro-\/controller devices. I used the U\-S\-A\-R\-T serial communication with A\-V\-R u\-C (X\-M\-E\-G\-A32\-D4) connected with a host computer as a test case. The protocol didn't have any solid demands but I stated it should be as lightweight as possible and as fast as possible sending large amount of information. The communication overhead of the tranport layer in average should be less than 15 bytes for 256 sent raw data. The data-\/link layer protocol was chosen to be S\-L\-I\-P. This protocol is very lightweight and robust. It doen't check for errors though. Thus the hight layer uses crc8 data checking and logical matching to verify the received packets.
